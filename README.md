# Mozio_Python_Backend_Project_2_1
coding's test
Use the main.py to run the code

My name is Lutende Joe Mande
It took me 26 hours to finish this backend project for web services

1. I used Microsoft Azure for the SQL database
   The SQL dabatase has two tables to store the service area's details and provider's details

2. I used DataSpell Notebook and Python to code a CRUD operations connected to the SQL database

3. I included into my coding a JSON REST AP for Google Maps to get the polygons or location
   In this process since I could not used a Google Map API Key, I used a library from a course I took online that can get the location

In conclusion, the project is 98% accurante and it has a small mistake of types (phone_number was set to float types); besides that every is working perfectly.

Thank you for Mozio for giving this opportunity to show my skills and to learn new information in the process.
