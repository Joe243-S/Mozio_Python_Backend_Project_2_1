# Mozio_Python_Backend_Project_2_1
coding's test
Use the Main.py to run the code

My name is Lutende Joe Mande
This is the backend project for web services

1. I used Azure SQL DataBase
   The SQL dabatase has two tables to store the service area's details and provider's details.

2. I used DataSpell Notebook and Python to code a CRUD operations (CRUD stands for C=Copy, R=Read, U=Update & D=Delete) connected to the Azure SQL DataBase

3. I included into my coding a JSON REST API for Google Maps to get the location's details
   In this process since I could not used a Google Map API Key, I used a library from a course I took online that can get the location's details.


Thank you to Mozio Group for giving me this opportunity to show my skills and to learn new information in the process.
